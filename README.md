### What is This?

It is an application that is responsible for calculating the fuel to be used for the session, very useful to maximize the weight of the vehicle and be faster in the race.

### How To Use?

This application actually has two modes, one designed for Assetto corsa competizione where you have two lists, one for all current ACC circuits and the other for all current ACC cars including all GT3, GT4 and GTC categories. When you specify the session time, the circuit and the car the program will do the necessary calculation to give you how many liters of fuel you need to finish the race.
