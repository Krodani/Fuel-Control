# Torch-Manager

What is This?
It is an application that is responsible for calculating the fuel that will be used for the session

How To Use?
This application currently has two modes, one designed for ACC where
you have two lists, one for the maps which are all ACC tracks and the other for the cars where you have all ACC cars including GT3 and GT4.

Some values are not implemented because they are from DLC but you can use the other mode.

And the other for any racing sim, Just insert your session time, lap per time, fuel per lap and the app says the averange result. You can check the "Extra" option to add a little more fuel to be safer
